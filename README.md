# Novelia-project

Abstract
This website will act as a platform for the writers to showcase their creativity and the language will not be limited to just English. Currently people who cannot enjoy their local novels due to inaccessibility or unavailability. The users will be able to get content from their favourite authors. The TTS(Text to Speech) feature can also be used by the readers who have visual imparity. 
This also helps in providing the users with the hands free feature so they can enjoy while doing their other work simultaneously.
